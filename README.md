# -Validation-of-remote-sensing-rainfall-data-using-a-network-of-ground-measurements
Validate two sets of remote sensing rainfall data TRMM and CHIRPS with rain gauge stations and choose the most fitting product per rainfall station.
Remote Sensing (RS) is an attractive new type of data source, especially in data-scarce 
regions. Several dedicated satellite missions exist to measure rainfall since the 80s. Often, 
this data is provided free of charge at daily or monthly resolution. Moreover, remote 
sensing data provides spatial-temporal information which can be used in combination 
ground measurements. In this group project you will work with two specific RS rainfall 
products: CHIRPS and TRMM. For more information of the datasets please visit the 
websites: https://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/ , https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps 

Important to try the python code, is to uncompress the .rar files, and have to be saved i the same directory. the latter is just a recomendation.
